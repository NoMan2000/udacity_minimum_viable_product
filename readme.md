# Minimum viable product

The idea behind the minimum viable product is to always deliver software, and to make sure that the software you are delivering is the software that the team expects.

Overdelivering, overengineering, or "scope creep" are all ways that software can become too bloated.  Remember, each line of code has to be checked, maintained, and tested against in all future iterations.  Therefore, the general rule is to write less code and features, because some of those features may never be used or not be what the customer or business wants.
